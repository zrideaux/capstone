      <h2>About the site</h2>
      <p>
        Today there are numerous causes that often don't receive the attention they need. 
        Many organizations and individuals search for resources, but lack the platform to reach a sufficient amount of people. 
        For those that are willing and able to provide help, there is a lack of a centralized collection of causes to contribute to. 
        In the case of a student who is eager to provide community service, they often have to go through extensive lengths to find opportunities where they can contribute.
        Similarly, it can be difficult for low income students to find fundraising or sponsorship opportunities in order to maintain their high school clubs or teams.  
        With this site, We hope to provide a opportunities for the eager and give a voice to those who might not be heard anywhere else.

              <p>
                I am a rising sophomore at Northeastern University in Massachusetts. 
                During quarantine I have taken this time to learn new things. 
                So far I have learned how to use a DSLR camera, cut my own hair, and build my own pc (AMD all the way).
                Aside from learning new things, I love to run, watch anime, and dance salsa/bachata. 
                If you are interested in any of these hobbies please feel free to ping me, I would love to talk about them with you!
