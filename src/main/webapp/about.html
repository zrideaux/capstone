            Today there are numerous causes that often donâ€™t receive the attention they need. 
            Many organizations and individuals search for resources, but lack the platform to reach a sufficient amount of people. 
            For those that are willing and able to provide help, there is a lack of a centralized collection of causes to contribute to. 
            In the case of a student who is eager to provide community service, they often have to go through extensive lengths to find opportunities where they can contribute.
            Similarly, it can be difficult for low income students to find fundraising or sponsorship opportunities in order to maintain their high school clubs or teams.
